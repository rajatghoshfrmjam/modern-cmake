# An Introduction to Modern CMake

People love to hate build systems.
Just watch the talks from CppCon17 to see examples of developers making the state of build systems the brunt of jokes.
This raises the question: Why?
Certainly there are no shortage of problems when building.
But I think that we have a very good solution to quite a few of those problems.
It's CMake. Not CMake 2.8 though; that was released before C++11 even existed!
Nor the horrible examples out there for CMake (even those posted on KitWare's own tutorials list).
I'm talking about Modern CMake. CMake 3.15+, maybe even CMake 4.0+!
It's clean, powerful, and elegant, so you can spend most of your time coding, not adding lines to an unreadable, unmaintainable Make (Or CMake 2) file.

In short, here are the most likely questions in your mind if you are considering Modern CMake:

## Why do I need a good build system?

Do any of the following apply to you?

- You want to avoid hard-coding paths
- You need to build a package on more than one computer
- You want to use CI (continuous integration)
- You need to support different OSs (maybe even just flavors of Unix)
- You want to support multiple compilers
- You want to use an IDE, but maybe not all of the time
- You want to describe how your program is structured logically, not flags and commands
- You want to use a library
- You want to use tools, like Clang-Tidy, to help you code
- You want to use a debugger

If so, you'll benefit from a CMake-like build system.

## Why must the answer be CMake?

Build systems are a hot topic. Of course there are many options. But even a really good one, or one that re-uses a familiar syntax, can't come close to CMake.
Why?
Support.
Every IDE supports CMake (or CMake supports that IDE).
More packages use CMake than any other system.
So, if you use a library that is designed to be included in your code, you have a choice: Make your own build system, or use one of the provided ones, and that will almost always include CMake.
And that will quickly be the common denominator if you include multiple projects.
And, if you need a library that's preinstalled, the chances of it having a find CMake script or config CMake script are excellent.

## Shouldn't I support the oldest version possible?

Short answer: No.

If you set your minimum version of CMake too low, CMake will produce a warning
or even an error. The oldest you can set it to is 3.5, with anything under 3.10
producing a warning, as of CMake 4.0 While a user can workaround this in
emergencies by setting `CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM` to a valid version, you
don't want users to have to do that.

You really should _at least_ use a version of CMake that came out after your
compiler, since it needs to know compiler flags, etc, for that version.  And,
since CMake will dumb itself down to the minimum required version in your CMake
file, installing a new CMake, even system wide, is pretty safe.  You should _at
least_ install it locally.  It's easy (1-2 lines in many cases), and you'll
find that 5 minutes of work will save you hundreds of lines and hours of
`CMakeLists.txt` writing, and will be much easier to maintain in the long run.

Quick summary of good minimums (more detail in book):

- 3.24: The package finding system is great, good minimum to support package authors.
- 3.18: Pretty good support for Python and CUDA, most systems have at least this.
- 3.15: This is as low as most projects should go, Ubuntu 20.04+ has 3.16+.
- 3.10: Lowest version to avoid a CMake warning, Ubuntu 18.04+.
- 3.5: If you _really_ need it.
- As long as you set a maximum version, you can even set minimums below this. But don't.

Always set the maximum version to the highest version you test (like 4.0).
This will continue to work until CMake drops the _maximum_ version from it's
support window, rather than the minimum!

This book tries to solve the problem of the poor examples and best practices
that you'll find proliferating the web.

There are some other places to find good information on the web. Here are some of them:

- [The official help](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/): Really amazing documentation. Nicely organized, great search, and you can toggle versions at the top. It just doesn't have a great "best practices tutorial", which is what this book tries to fill in.
- [Effective Modern CMake](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1): A great list of do's and don'ts.
- [Embracing Modern CMake](https://steveire.wordpress.com/2017/11/05/embracing-modern-cmake/): A post with good description of the term
- [It's time to do CMake Right](https://pabloariasal.github.io/2018/02/19/its-time-to-do-cmake-right/): A nice set of best practices for Modern CMake projects.
- [The Ultimate Guide to Modern CMake](https://rix0r.nl/blog/2015/08/13/cmake-guide/): A slightly dated post with similar intent.
- [More Modern CMake](https://youtu.be/y7ndUhdQuU8): A great presentation from Meeting C++ 2018 that recommends CMake 3.12+. This talk makes calls CMake 3.0+ "Modern CMake" and CMake 3.12+ "More Modern CMake".
- [Oh No! More Modern CMake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9kSr5enrSk): The sequel to More Modern CMake.
- [toeb/moderncmake](https://github.com/toeb/moderncmake): A nice presentation and examples about CMake 3.5+, with intro to syntax through project organization
